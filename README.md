# Food-Ordering-System
This project is a simple restaurant ordering system that runs in the console. Customers or staff can view the menu (with prices), place orders by selecting item IDs and quantities, and see the total cost. It also keeps track of all past orders for reference. Perfect for small restaurants to manage orders efficiently without complex setups.
